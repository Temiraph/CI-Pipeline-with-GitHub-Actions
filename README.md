# CI Pipeline with GitHub Actions

[![CI](https://github.com/Temiraph/CI-Pipeline-with-GitHub-Actions/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Temiraph/CI-Pipeline-with-GitHub-Actions/actions)

A simple, lightweight Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline for a Node.js project using GitHub Actions.  
Automatically runs on push, pull requests, and nightly schedules to detect issues early.

---

## ðŸš€ What it does

- Runs tests on **Node.js 20 & 22** via a matrix strategy  
- Triggers on `push`, `pull_request`, `schedule` (nightly), and manual dispatch  
- Uses npm caching (based on `package-lock.json`) for faster installs  
- Prevents duplicate workflow runs (via concurrency settings)  
- Clean setup with minimal permissions  

---

## ðŸ§° Setup & Usage

1. Clone or fork this repo  
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   npm install
Run tests locally

npm test


Push a commit or open a PR â€” CI runs automatically.

Project scripts

npm test â€” runs a minimal smoke test (Nodeâ€™s built-in test runner)

CI details (./.github/workflows/ci.yml)

Uses actions/checkout@v4 and actions/setup-node@v4

Caches npm based on package-lock.json

Matrix strategy for Node 20 & 22

Scheduled cron (02:30 UTC by default)

Troubleshooting

Cache step failing âžœ Ensure package-lock.json is committed.

PR shows 0 checks âžœ If PR is to an upstream repo, CI may require maintainer approval. PR within your fork will run immediately.

Why multiple checks? âžœ Matrix (2 Node versions) Ã— Events (push + PR) = multiple runs.
